# scope_guard intro [under construction]
A C++11 scope guard. [TODO]

### Main features
- [x] &ge; C++11
- [ ] Single `make_scope_guard` function interface
- [x] Fast (no added runtime `std::function` penalties)
- [x] General: accepts any callable that respects the preconditions
[below](#preconditions)
- [x] no implicitly ignored return (see [below](#void-return))
- [ ] Option to enforce `noexcept` in C++17
(see [below](#option-sg_require_noexcept_in_cpp17))

### Other characteristics
- [x] No dependencies to use (besides &ge;C++11 compiler and standard library)
- [x] No macros to make guard - just write explicit lambda or bind or what have
you
- [ ] Extensively tested [TODO link to tests]
- [x] Unlicense(d)
- [x] `snake_case` style

# Usage
To use,  simply clone this repository, copy the header file within, and include 
it - there are no dependencies (besides a &ge;C++11 compiler). Then do something
like:

```c++
auto guard1 = make_scope_guard(my_callback);
auto guard2 = make_scope_guard([]()noexcept{ /* do something */ });
...
```

See tests for more examples [TODO link tests].

## Preconditions

Besides being invocable with no arguments, the callback that is used to create a `scope_guard` must respect the following preconditions.

### void return

The callback must return void. Returning anything else is intentionally not
accepted. This forces the client to confirm their intention, by explicitly
writing code to ignore a return, if that really is what they want. For example:

```c++
bool foo() noexcept; // definition elsewhere
make_scope_guard(foo); // ERROR: does not return void
make_scope_guard(()[] noexcept {/*bool ignored =*/ foo();}); // OK
```

The idea is not only to catch unintentional cases but also to highlight
intentional ones for code readers.

### no throw

The callback _is required_ not to throw. Notice,
however, that this is not checked by default and throwing from a
`scope_guard` callback results in a call to std::terminate. This follows the
same approach as custom deleters in such standard library types as `unique_ptr`
and `shared_ptr` (see `[unique.ptr.single.ctor]` and
`[unique.ptr.single.dtor]` in the C++ standard.).

I acknowledge that the destructor for `scope_guard` could
be conditionally `noexcept` instead, but that is not advisable either and would
create a false sense of safety (better _fail-fast_-ish, I suppose).

Personally, I prefer to enforce that the callback be
`noexcept` at compile-time, but this not only restricts acceptable callback
types, to my knowledge it is not even possible until C++17. That is because the
exception specification is not part of the type system
[until then](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2015/p0012r1.html).

## Option `SG_REQUIRE_NOEXCEPT_IN_CPP17`

If &ge;C++17 is used, the preprocessor macro
`SG_REQUIRE_NOEXCEPT_IN_CPP17` can be defined to
make `scope_guard`'s constructor require a
[nothrow invocable](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/types/is_invocable)
at compile-time, e.g.

```c++
#define SG_REQUIRE_NOEXCEPT_IN_CPP17 // only meaningful in >=C++17
#include "scope_guard.hpp"
make_scope_guard([](){}); // ERROR: need noexcept
make_scope_guard([]() noexcept {}); // OK
```

Notice however, that this restricts the types that `scope_guard` accepts
considerably. That is one of the reasons why it is disabled by default. The
other is to maintain the same behavior as in &lt;C++17.

This option has no effect unless &ge;C++17 is used.

### Implications

Unfortunately, even in C++17 things are not ideal, and information on
exception specification is not propagated to types like `std::function` or
the result of `std::bind`. For instance, the following code does not compile
in C++17:

```c++
void f() noexcept { }
auto stdf_noexc = std::function<void(&)()noexcept>{f}; // ERROR (at least in g++ and clang++)
auto stdf_declt = std::function<decltype(f)>{f};       // ERROR (at least in g++ and clang++)
auto stdf = std::function<void()>{f};                  // fine, but drops noexcept info
```

Since `SG_REQUIRE_NOEXCEPT_IN_CPP17` means rejecting anything that
is not known to possess an `operator() noexcept`, the additional
safety sacrifices generality. Of course the user can still use functions and
lambdas to wrap anything else, e.g.:

    make_scope_guard([&foo]()noexcept{std::bind(bar, foo)})

# Running tests
There are two dependencies to execute the tests:
- Cmake (at least version 3.1)
- Catch2
    
## Instructions
(For GNU/Linux, should be analogous in other systems.)

1. Install [cmake](https://cmake.org/) (&ge; v3.8)
2. Get and install [Catch2](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2):
    ```
    $ git clone https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2 <catch_src_dir>
    $ mkdir <catch_bin_dir>
    $ cd <catch_bin_dir>
    $ cmake <catch_src_dir>
    $ make
    $ make install
    ```
3. Clone and build this repo:
    ```
    $ git clone https://github.com/ricab/scope_guard.git <guard_src_dir>
    $ mkdir <guard_bin_dir>
    $ cd <guard_bin_dir>
    $ cmake [options] <guard_src_dir>
    $ make
    $ make test
    ```

Note: to obtain more output (e.g. because there was a failure), run
`VERBOSE=1 make test_verbose` instead, to get the command lines used in
compilation tests as well as the test output.

### cmake Options
The custom cmake option `SG_CXX17` is available to compile with C++17 (or
c++1z in earlier compilers). When `SG_CXX17` is on, the dependent option
`SG_REQUIRE_NOEXCEPT_IN_CPP17` becomes available. This is translated to the
preprocessor define of the same name, with the effect documented
[above](#option-sg_require_noexcept_in_cpp17).
